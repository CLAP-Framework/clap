## Background

This code is a research oriented full stack autonomous driving platform. 
It has been implemented on the real autonomous vechiels as well as CARLA simluator.


## Usage

### Running with CARLA: compatible and easily access

> Please checkout the branch: dev/zhcao/master

The goals for this repository are:

1. Easily setup the environment: mainly using python
2. Easily transfer to real vehicle driving: Sharing the same code environment with the real vehicle implementment

### Running on real vehicles: efficient and stable

> Please checkout the branch: dev/xiaopengG3

The goals for this repository are:

1. Same codes with the real vehicle driving
2. Efficient: Codes are written in C++ for efficiency.

Example driving data can be downloaded from:
