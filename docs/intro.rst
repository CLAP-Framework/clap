###################

The automated driving system is separated into following modules

* :doc:`/modules/perception`
* :doc:`/modules/navigation`
* :doc:`/modules/cognition`
* :doc:`/modules/planning`
* :doc:`/modules/control`

These modules works like a reflex arc of human, the sensor input is processed by perception module, then organized and intepreted by cognition, then decision is made by perception module, and output command produce actuator signals.
