# limited in a scope of a road section (i.e. road network edge)
# For extension, the junction shape information is provided
# For safety concerns, the next unit (i.e. edge or junction) is provided

# Lanes if it's in a structured road, should be sorted by ascending index
# The index is starting from right most lane, i.e. the right most lane is indexed as 0
